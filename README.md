This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts whether a student will get placed or not, based on various academic and personal factors like CGPA, skills, and backlogs. It is built using Python, with Flask as the backend framework, and includes a simple login and signup system to manage user access. Users need to register and log in before they can access the placement prediction form. Once logged in, they can enter their details, and the trained machine learning model (saved using pickle) will return a prediction indicating whether the student is likely to be placed. The frontend is created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for responsiveness, while the backend uses popular Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and numpy. The project is also structured to be deployed on platforms like Render or Heroku. Overall, this system can help students and educational institutions assess placement readiness in a quick and interactive way.
