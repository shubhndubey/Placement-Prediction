🎓 Placement Prediction System
A machine learning-based web application built with Flask to predict whether a student will be placed or not, based on various academic and personal features.

🚀 Overview
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict student placement outcomes. It is designed to help students and career counselors understand the placement probability based on input features such as marks , CGPA, technical skills and more.

🔧 Tech Stack
Backend: Flask (Python)

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 , Javascript 

📊 Features
Predicts whether a student will get placed or not.

User-friendly interface to input student data.

Displays prediction result with interpretation.

Modular code structure for easy updates and scalability.
